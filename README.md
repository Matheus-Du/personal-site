# personal-site

This repo contains the source code for my personal portfolio and blog site, [matheusdu.dev](https://matheusdu.dev). This full-stack site was built with React, Flask, and MongoDB. It's currently deployed on my personal home server using Cloudflare, Docker, and Nginx proxy manager.

This site was designed to be very lightweight and simple. I've omitted any frontend frameworks outside of React and have tried to keep the client-side processing to a minimum. As a result, the site achieves a FCP (First Contentful Paint) score of 0.3s and has a TBT (Total Blocking Time) of 0ms.

The writeup for this project, which is mostly about how I went about setting up my home web server, is available [here](https://matheusdu.dev/#/blog/a-complete-guide-to-building-and-deploying-a-website-on-your-home-server).
